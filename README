MultiWaveInfer v1.0.1
=================================================
Short description:
MultiWaveInfer is designed to estimate the parameters of multi-waves,
multi-ancestral populations admixture models by the ancestral tracks. 
The program proceed in two steps: Firstly, use EM-algorithm to identify 
the waves for each ancestral population. Secondly, use the theoretical
length distribution of ancestral tracks to estimate the parameters.    

1.Compile
1.1 Library dependency
MultiWaveInfer depend on boost library, make sure the boost is installed.
Installation of boost can be found at 
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html

1.2 Compile from source code
It's very easy to compile from the source code by the following commands:

bash$ tar -zvxf MultiWaveInfer.tar.gz
bash$ cd MultiWaveInfer/src
bash$ make

After compiling, you will get the executable MultiWaveInfer, just
typing the command below to get help information:

bash$ ./MultiWaveInfer -h or bash$ ./MultiWaveInfer --help

2. Test with the toy data
2.1 two simple examples

bash$ ./MultiWaveInfer --input ../example/two.seg

Example explanation:
MultiWaveInfer will read the ancestral tracks from two.seg,
after a while, the optimal model and corresponding generation and 
proportion will print to screen. The format will explained later.

The following is output of the toy data:

// COMMAND ./MultiWaveInfer --input ../example/two.seg 

Reading data from ../example/two.seg...
Start scan for admixture waves... 
Perform EM scan for waves of population 2...
Perform EM scan for waves of population 1...
Finished scanning for admixture waves.

There is(are) 2 wave(s) of admixture event(s) detected

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We use a tree to present the results. The simulated admixed population has 
two reference populations (population 1 and 2). There are 2 waves of admixture 
events. The first admixture event was happened in 24 generations ago. The 
ancestral populations are pop2 and pop1 and corresponding mixture proportions 
are 0.198398 and 0.801602. The second admixture event was happened in 11 
generations ago. The ancestral population and corresponding mixture proportions
is pop1 and 0.384016.
 
User can redirect the output to a file, such as:

bash$ ./MultiWaveInfer --input ../example/sim1.seg > sim1_opt.log

2.2 A full arguments example

bash$ ./MultiWaveInfer -i ../example/sim1.seg -l 0.01 -a 0.01 -e 0.0001 \
-m 5000 > sim1_fopt.log

Example explanation:
Again, MultiWaveInfer read ancestral tracks from file sim1.seg, discard
the tracks shorter than 0.01 Morgan, the significance level of LRT is 0.01,
and the convergent condition is 0.0001, and the Max number of iterations 
to perform EM is 5000. Finally, the outputs will be redirected to sim1_fopt.log.

3. File format
3.1 Input file format
MultiWaveInfer is easy to use, only need one file, in which each line 
represents a ancestral track with the start point, end points, from 
which ancestry the track originates. The start and end points units 
are in Morgan.
 
For example:

0.00000000      0.34602058      Yoruba
0.34602058      0.34614778      French
......
0.40759031      0.41517938      Yoruba

4. Arguments
-i/--input <string>
	This argument is required, in which user specify the filename of 
input ancestral tracks, format described above.

-a/--alpha [double]
	This argument is optional, in which user specify the significance
level to reject null hypothesis in LRT. Default is 0.05.

-e/--epsilon [double]
	This argument is optional, in which user specify epsilon to check 
whether a parameter converge or not. Default is 0.000001.

-l/--lower [double]
	This argument is optional, in which user specify the lower bound
to discard short tracks. The default is 0, which does not discard any
short tracks. However, due to method limitation in local ancestry 
inference, very short tracks are generally not reliable.

-p/--minProp [double]
	This argument is optional, in which user specify the minimum survival 
proportion for a wave at the final generation. Default is 0.01.

-m/--maxIt [integer]	 
	This argument is also optional, in which user specify the maximum 
number of iterations to perform EM. Default is 10000. 

5. Options
-h/--help
	Print help message, default is OFF
-s/--simple
	Run in simple mode, default is OFF
Here simple mode refer to the scenario in which each parental population 
contributes only one pulse of admixture (one wave).
